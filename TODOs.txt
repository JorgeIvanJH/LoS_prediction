EXPERIMENTATION:

    What to do with numric cap? (120+ LoS, cap and treat as number? remove?)

    Baseline
        Simple model
        Explicit missingness indicators
    Representation learning
        Text embeddings if available
        Otherwise code embeddings (not diagnosis imputation)
    Multitask learning
        Auxiliary diagnosis prediction
    Ablation study
        With vs without diagnosis-derived features
        With vs without missingness flags
    Free-hand text fields -> Usable? 




Consider:
    Transfer from Emergency to Inpatient (maybe predict only impatient, but have additional column indicating it was previously emergency?)
